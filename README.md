Goal: Use Machine Learning to predict future crimes in certain cities/locations.
  
    NOTE: I think we should pull data from a collection of sources, either focused on the same city or on a collection of cities in a certain area.

## Datasets

City of Chicago - https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2

Chicago O'Hare weather Data - https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets/GHCND/stations/GHCND:USW00094846/detail

Crime Classification Codes - https://gis.chicagopolice.org/pages/crime_details

Used to classify violent crimes - https://chicagopd.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/8ed0652c9b2a4bc6bf1173e6aae6add4

## Communication Protocols

- Primary daily communication through use of #Group-6 Slack chat.
- Working sessions every Monday and Wednesday from 7:00p-9:00p with an additional working session on Saturday from 8:00a-10:00a.


## Outline of Project with tools

1. Data collection via either CSV file or JSON format.
2. Data cleaning using Pandas
3. Database creation using SQL
4. Machine Learning model using Python/Jupyter Notebook/Sci-kit Learn
5. Visualize ML output using Tableau or JavaScript
