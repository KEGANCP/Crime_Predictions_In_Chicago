# Topic 
Crime Predictions in Chicago based on specific weather conditions via Machine Learning.

We have selected this topic to determine what correlation certain weather patterns have on violent crimes committed within Chicago. Our analysis could be useful for a wide range of purpose; from those seeking potential vacation travel to Chicago, to law enforcement better equipped to forecast violent crime within their precinct.



# Goal
Our goal is to utilize Machine Learning to predict future crimes within Chicago based on specific weather conditions.
In order to generate the desired findings we will be using the below datasets to analyze and test through different machine learning methods.

[Chicago Weather Data](https://github.com/KEGANCP/Crime_Predictions_In_Chicago/blob/AustenM/data/clean_weather_data.csv)

[Crime Data SAMPLE](https://github.com/KEGANCP/Crime_Predictions_In_Chicago/blob/AustenM/data/sample_crime_data.csv)

[Logistic Regression SAMPLE](https://github.com/KEGANCP/Crime_Predictions_In_Chicago/blob/triangle/sample_logistic_reg.ipynb)

ERD:

    NOTE: I think we should pull data from a collection of sources, either focused on the same city or on a collection of cities in a certain area.
